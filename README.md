Hello fellow thinkers,

I'm Derien. I'm new to writing code, but not new to analytical problem solving. I've been problem solving in areas such as philosphy, math, and psychology for most of my formal educational history.

Currently, I'm teaching myself all the math I can. From algebra to physics with the long term goal of becoming an engineer.

A shorter term goal is to land a software developing job in a few months. Hoping for August 2021. Python is the language I'm learning now. I'm building a Django portfolio site to put all my projects on. Then I'll work on others to fill the emptiness of the site.

If you're looking to collab or need a thinker on a project of yours, I'd love to help. I want to gain as much experience as I can.

Would also love to make new friends.

Hit me up!
